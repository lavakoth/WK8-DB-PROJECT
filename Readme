# LibraryDB SQL Schema

This project contains the SQL schema for a Library Management System database.

## Database Structure

The schema defines the following tables:

- **Authors**: Stores author information.
- **Categories**: Stores book categories/genres.
- **Books**: Stores book details.
- **BookAuthors**: Junction table for the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.
- **BookCategories**: Junction table for the many-to-many relationship between books and categories.
- **Members**: Stores library member information.
- **Borrowings**: Tracks which members have borrowed which books.
- **Fines**: Tracks fines associated with late returns.
- **Reservations**: Tracks book reservations by members.

## How to Use

1. Open your MySQL client (such as MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line).
2. Run the SQL script in [`answer.sql`](answer.sql) to create the database and all tables.

## Features

- Supports multiple authors per book and multiple categories per book.
- Tracks book borrowings, returns, fines, and reservations.
- Enforces referential integrity with foreign keys and cascading deletes where appropriate.

## File List

- [`answer.sql`](answer.sql): Main SQL script to create the database schema.
